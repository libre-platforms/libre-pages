# LibrePages
LibrePages is a free software project to provide a simple set of tools to easily build web applications using PHP.
Its focus does not lie on the development of fullstack applications, but on REST API development.

## Documentation
The source code contains most documentation you need to get started.
You can also find a couple of examples in the existing project code.

To get a bigger overview of the functionality available to you, you can generate docs via phpDocumentor.
As soon as you installed it, you can use the script in `doc` to generate proper docs.
